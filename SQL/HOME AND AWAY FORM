###Query to identify the home and away performance(Home and Away Wins,Home and Away Draws) of top 5 teams against all other teams(Not all teams query will be listed, but it will show the general idea)

###Home Wins

/*SELECT home_team,away_team,season, count(result) AS Home_Wins
FROM `valid-amplifier-343113.STATS.Results`
where home_team='Manchester City' AND result='H' 
group by home_team, away_team, season
order by season*/

###Away Wins
/*SELECT home_team,away_team,season, count(result) Away_Wins
FROM `valid-amplifier-343113.STATS.Results`
where Away_team='Manchester City AND result='A' 
group by home_team, away_team,season
order by season*/

###Home Draws
/*SELECT home_team,away_team,season, count(result) AS Home_Draws
FROM `valid-amplifier-343113.STATS.Results`
where home_team='Manchester City' AND result='D' 
group by home_team, away_team, season
order by season*/

###Away Draws
/*SELECT home_team,away_team,season, count(result) AS Away_Draws
FROM `valid-amplifier-343113.STATS.Results`
where Away_team='Manchester City'  AND result='D' 
group by season, home_team,away_team
order by season*/




#Query to sum the result column created above to show the amount of times a team won or drew all season long (Home and Away)

#The Query also changes away team and home team to "team" in both draws and wins tables so they can be joined successfully later on


/*SELECT home_team as team,season, sum(Home_Draws) AS totaL_home_Draws
FROM `valid-amplifier-343113.fresh.man city home draws`
group by home_team, season
order by season*/


/*SELECT away_team as team,season, sum(away_Draws) AS totaL_away_Draws
FROM `valid-amplifier-343113.fresh.man city away draws` 
group by away_team, season
order by season*/


/*SELECT home_team as team,season, sum(Home_Wins) AS totaL_home_Wins
FROM `valid-amplifier-343113.NEW.Manchester City Home Wins`
group by home_team, season
order by season*/


/*SELECT away_team as team,season, sum(away_Wins) AS totaL_away_Wins
FROM `valid-amplifier-343113.NEW.Manchester city total away wins` 
group by away_team, season
order by season*/


###Query to update missing rows with zero to maintain data quality.


/*insert into `valid-amplifier-343113.fresh.Man city total home draws`(team,season,total_home_draws)
values ('Manchester City','2008-2009',0)*/


#Accidentally added the wrong row, used the delete from command to remove the wrong row

/*delete from `valid-amplifier-343113.fresh.Man city total home draws`
where team= "Manchester United"*/




##Query to Join Draw Tables (Home and Away) for each team. Do same for Win Tables.So we can arrive at draw Tables and Win Tables.


/*select *
from `valid-amplifier-343113.fresh.Man city total away draws`
full join `valid-amplifier-343113.fresh.Man city total home draws`
using (team,season)
order by season*/

/*select *
from `valid-amplifier-343113.active.Man city total away wins`
full join `valid-amplifier-343113.active.Man city total home wins`
using (team,season)
order by season*/



###Query to join Draw and Win Tables for each team



/*select *
from `valid-amplifier-343113.Arsenal_and_Others.LIVERPOOL WINS`
full join `valid-amplifier-343113.Arsenal_and_Others.LIVERPOOL DRAWS `
using (team,season)
order by season*/
